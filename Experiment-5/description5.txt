Let’s make shopping smarter!
In this activity, I created a simple product filtering tool where you can choose a category and instantly see only the matching products. No page reloads, no waiting—just smooth updates right inside the webpage.

It’s a great way to learn how JavaScript can interact with HTML elements, filter data, and update the page dynamically.

- Product list on display
  All items (Clothing, Electronics, Books) are stored in JavaScript as objects with categories.

- Filter with a dropdown
  You can pick “Clothing,” “Electronics,” “Books,” or “All” from the dropdown, and only the relevant products will appear.

- Instant updates
  JavaScript listens to your choice and updates the list in real time—no refresh button needed.

- Clean design
  A simple box, styled with CSS, neatly shows the products and the filter menu.

- Why it’s useful
  This is the same logic used by e-commerce sites to let you filter items by category, making shopping easier.

Basically, it’s like building a mini Amazon filter system with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
