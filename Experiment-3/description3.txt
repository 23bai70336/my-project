ADMIN DASHBOARD
We have created Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching.
We have designed and build a professional, responsive admin dashboard interface using HTML, CSS Grid layout, 
and a theme switching feature (light and dark modes).

In styles we have created root :{} for the background colours of the main content area, nav bar, header, footer.
also we have created a input function for the checkbox which turns the theme dark. 
it is done by adding the body into the <div> section which makes the whole body integrated in the div class Dashboard,
Created the theme switch using CSS.
