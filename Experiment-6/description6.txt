Let’s draw right inside the browser!
In this activity, I built a little SVG drawing tool where you can drag your mouse and create freehand lines on the screen. As soon as you press down and move the mouse, a blue path starts following your movements like a digital pen. When you let go, the drawing stops—just like lifting your pen off paper.

It’s an easy but powerful way to see how JavaScript and SVG can work together to make interactive art directly on a webpage.

- Drawing with your mouse
  Every time you click and drag, the tool starts sketching lines right under your cursor.

- Smooth path creation
  The code keeps track of your mouse position and connects each movement with straight lines, forming a path.

- Instant response
  As you move, the line updates live—no reload, no extra steps.

- Practical and fun
  This is the same idea behind digital whiteboards or sketchpads on websites.

- Easy setup
  Just one <svg> area, a bit of styling, and a few lines of JavaScript to handle mouse events.

 Basically, it’s like turning your browser into a mini paint app with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
